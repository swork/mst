Impulser accepts Click, serial line interrupt, timing system impulse,
whatever and logs a finish time impulse. On receipt of update notice,
adds recent activity to running update view.

Recorder accepts bib numbers or notice placards ('999' etc.),
logs. IFF COMPLETELY UNAMBIGUOUS, MIGHT match next finish impulse and
broadcast an update notice.

Editor handles matchup of ambiguous cases.

"Sequel Pro" is ad-hoc database manipulator, let's be careful out
there.

and insert/delete.

A Undo could be "click on impulse to assign to FalseImpulse rider"
